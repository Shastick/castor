Welcome to Castor,

this project toys around with Identity Based Authentication and Ciphertext Based Attribute Encryption to encrypt and authenticate syslog messages.

You can easily build it with SBT. The only thing you have to take care of yourself is installing the PBC library and the java layer wrapping around, following these steps: http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/docs/pbcwrapper.html

The CPABE part currently uses the implementation found here: https://github.com/wakemecn/cpabe/ 
A fork reflecting a few additions can be found here: https://github.com/Shastick/cpabe 
At the moment, Castor directly contains the CPABE library.

Please don't hesitate to e-mail me any question you could have,
J.
