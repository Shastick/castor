{"name":"Castor","body":"##  CASTOR\r\nLog-file encryption and authentication utility toying with **Attribute Based Encryption** (_ABE_) and **Identity Based Authentication** (_IBA_), along AES and RSA.\r\n\r\nCastor serves as a syslog message processer and is able to handle any message respecting the syslog format, while adaptations to any other format are simple.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Install & Compile\r\nGet the code:\r\n\r\n`git clone git://github.com/Shastick/castor.git`\r\n\r\n`cd castor`\r\n\r\nInitialize and update the submodules (to pull the cpabe library)\r\n\r\n`git submodule init`\r\n\r\n`git submodule update`\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else than the two cpabe and bswabe directories in `cpabe/src/main/java/`, move to the specified directory and switch to the stripped branch:\r\n\r\n`cd cpabe/src/main/java/`\r\n\r\n`git checkout stripped`\r\n\r\nYou should now be ready to compile:\r\n\r\n`sbt compile`\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to run castor from sbt, you'll have to move the `conf` and `\r\nfile` directories to the `castor` root.\r\n\r\n`mv castor/conf ./`\r\n\r\n`mv castor/files ./`\r\n\r\n`sbt compile`\r\n\r\n`sbt run`\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nLook at https://github.com/Shastick/castor/blob/master/castor/conf/digester_config.example.scala\r\nand https://github.com/Shastick/castor/blob/master/castor/conf/reader_config.example.scala for configuration examples.\r\n\r\nHave fun, and don't hesitate if you have any questions!\r\nJ.","tagline":"Syslog Messages Authentication and Encryption","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
